Gomoku Challenge given by GSN.

I have implemented the minimax alpha-beta prunning algorithm.
The first step to helping try speeding up the algorithm, I'm only searching the neighbors of the squares that have a piece on them. This eliminates a lot of the board.

I would have like to put in a lot of heuristics checks, but I didn't want to spend too much time perfecting this.

At one point at attempted to put in a max allotted time on the AI, but I kept getting very odd bugs so I took that out. It would be something to make the AI a little easier to play against.

There are a few minor bugs I didn't get to work out but I think the gist of the code is there.
